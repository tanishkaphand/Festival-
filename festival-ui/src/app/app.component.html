  <h2>🎊 Welcome to the Festival Management Platform in our web</h2>
  <p>
    This platform serves as a digital space to organize, monitor, and celebrate festivals in a structured manner.
    With real-time listings, easy input forms, and planning features, it becomes easier than ever to manage
    cultural and social events across regions and communities.

    The Festival Management System is a web application designed to help organize, manage,
    and promote festivals efficiently. It allows admins to add, update, and track festival
    details such as name, date, location, and category. Visitors can easily search, filter,
    and explore events with interactive maps, calendar views, and image galleries.
    This system streamlines event management, improves coordination, and enhances the
    overall festival experience.
